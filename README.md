This program allows you to easily switch profiles without using the Jagex Launcher directly. The program is designed to be used in conjunction with [Microbot](https://github.com/chsami/Microbot). However can be used as a standalone for other clients that use the runelite credential system to launch.
## Account overview

Here you setup your accounts. You can add, remove and switch manually to an account. Please read the "Guide" on how to add new runelite profiles to the program.

This is the main part of the program. Here you can see all your accounts and track already running clients. Please be aware that clients that are started manually will **not** be tracked.
You can choose to start a specific client or all clients at once. You can also choose to kill a specific client.

## Settings

By default, the program will automatically try to find the `.runelite` folder for you and the Configuration Location will be set to within the folder of the program.
If you want to use the *Account Handler*, you will need to direct a Microbot jar file for the program to use.
